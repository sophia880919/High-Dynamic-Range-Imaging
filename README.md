# High-Dynamic-Range-Imaging
Compared to Low Dynamic Range (LDR) images, High Dynamic Range (HDR) images display a broader luminance range, revealing more details and subtle color variations. This Python-based project includes functions for image rescaling, cropping, alignment, histogram equalization (CLAHE), HDR reconstruction, and tone mapping.

1. Install the required libraries for running the program.
$python3 pip install -r requirement.txt

2. Generate HDR image 
$python3 hdr.py â€“save_name=output

3. Finally, the outputs will be saved to the ./output directory.
