# High-Dynamic-Range-Imaging
Compared to Low Dynamic Range (LDR) images, High Dynamic Range (HDR) images display a broader luminance range, revealing more details and subtle color variations. This Python-based project includes functions for image rescaling, cropping, alignment, histogram equalization (CLAHE), HDR reconstruction, and tone mapping.
